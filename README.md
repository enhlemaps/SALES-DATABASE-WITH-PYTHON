#  Sales Database System with Python Integration

## Overview
This project involved building and interacting with a sales database in *SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)* and connecting it to a *Python program* via the pyodbc library. The database contains product sales data (e.g., cameras and electronics), and the Python application allows users to interact with the data through a custom-built user interface.

The system performs queries, rollups, drilldowns, and visualizations â€” and was developed as part of a school assignment.

## Project Goals
- Create a sales database in SSMS
- Import real sales data into SQL Server
- Connect Python to the database using pyodbc
- Build a *user interface* to interact with the data
- Perform analytical operations (roll-up, drawdown)
- Generate graphs and tables from queried data

---

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Python (via PyCharm)
- pyodbc (for database connection)
- pandas, matplotlib (for data analysis & visualization)

---

## Key Features
- *Data Import*: Sales data imported into SSMS
-  *Database Connection*: Live connection between Python and SQL Server
- *User Interface (UI)*: Users can input queries and receive results through an easy-to-use interface
-  *Roll-up & Drawdown Analysis*: Summarized and detailed sales breakdowns
-  *Visual Output*: Dynamic tables and graphs to show performance trends

## What I Learned
- How to create and connect to a relational database from Python
- How to import and structure large datasets in SSMS
- How to build a working graphical user interface (GUI)
- Advanced querying, troubleshooting connection errors, and refining database logic
- Improved confidence in debugging and integrating tools for real-world use
